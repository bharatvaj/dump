Setup Scripts
=============

Welcome! Stranger on the internet. This repo contains all the configuration that are required to recreate my workflow.

My workflow is mostly based on the following principles,

- Stay on terminal whenever possible. Don't switch between keyboard and mouse often.
- Use software which are open source. So fixing is easy when something goes wrong.
- Use software which are configurable and easy to setup. It should have a dotfile that can be easily copied around.
- Use fairly safe settings that are easy to deploy and rollback. 
- Emphasize on security.
- Use cross-platform solutions whenever possible.
- Remove bloat as safely as possible. Reducing the attack surface is always a great idea.
